        I like technology, writting code and doing DIY projects, usually with
        raspberry pis and arduinos. I like typed languages like GO and
        Typescript. Ironically this portfolio is written in JavaScript.

        Some of my other hobbies include meditation. My goal is to become free
        from suffering, gain insight and wisdom and achieve ultimate freedom,
        experience nothing. The technique is called zazen. It means sitting,
        it&apos;s from zen buddhism. What is zen? Can&apos;t say, cause
        it&apos;s not a word ;)

      <p>I like to exercise as well. It keeps you healthy and happy.</p>

        My mission in life is to be a good person, don&apos;t cause any
        unnecessary suffering, be compassionate and helpful. Love every sentient
        being unconditionally.

      <p>I like to pet dogs, eat spinach and drink Cola.</p>
